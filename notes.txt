Services can be provided using:
    1) @Injectable
    2) providers: [] inside bootstrapApplication method - service included in the initial bundle

The first approach is preferable, since the services provided using @Injectable,
are loaded only when they are needed in the application (lazy loading) which results
in more optimized code bundles.
